<li>This was also my first game prototype I created with Unreal Engine whilst it was set in the Japanese language, which added to the challenge. </li>

<li>My main responsibilities included game design and functionality, level design and asset placement.</li>

Due to the theme, having both the player's health and light's in the world be affected by this was also an interesting challenge.</li>
