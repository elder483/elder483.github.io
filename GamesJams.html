      <p>A small slice of a puzzle game inspired by The Legend of Zelda Spirit Tracks. This marks the first gamnes jam I developed in Unity, focusing primarily on the gameplay & design and increasing my Unity skills.</p>
<ul>
<l>The first Games Jam that I've made using the Unity engine during the final week of my games engine bootcamp, furthermore I did this also in Japanese. </l>
<l>I also made a design document for this one it's quite brief due to time constraints, however, all the information present is still relevant, I'm looking to refine the project further and expand it.</l>
<l> Experimented with Animations, VFX, level design, lighting and some programming.</l>
<l>First time I implemented my own voice for a game, also created the songs used in the game.</l>
<l>First time I made a build using WebGL. </l>

</ul>

      <p>An endless runner mixed with skateboarding action. Focusing primarily on the gameplay & design and increasing my UI skills.</p>

<l> My main responsibilities included game design and functionality.</l>
<l> Due to the limitation in time with this Jam which consisted of three days, there was a lot of content that didn't make the final build. 
(Examples include, more zones, with different enemies with unique mechanics, Unique tiles to that Zone, more skateboarding skills for the player to utilise, pickups such as a shield.)</l>
<l>This was also my first game prototype I created with Unreal Engine whilst it was set in the Japanese language, which added to the challenge. </l>

      <p>A horror game utlising 2D assets into making a 3D world, Experimented with AI.</p>

      <ul>
<l>In this Games Jam,  I took the role of project lead, which required me to manage my other team mate and request the necessary art assets as well as stretch goals. </l>
<l> My main responsibilities included game design and functionality, level design and asset placement. </l>
<l> This duration of this Jam was three days, this meant tasks had to be completed at a rapid rate, fortunately the game provided a nice prototype in which the player has to manage their heart rate. 
Due to the theme, having both the player's health and light's in the world be affected by this was also an interesting challenge.   </l>
