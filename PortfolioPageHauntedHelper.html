    <section>
<h2>Overview</h2>
    
<p>The game was heavily inspired by The Legend of Zelda, Link's Awakening for the switch and the DS game legend of Zelda Spirit Tracks. The games Jam's theme this time was a "helping hand".</p>
<p>The main objective for the player is to navigate the dungeon and get the human to reach the goal.
 Using the ability to use your ghost, the player will now take control of the ghost, the ghost has the ability to posses both the human and enemies in the scene.
 Each enemy has their own unique ability, that the player gets to use whilst possessed.</p>
<p>This fits the theme perfectly, as the human needs the ghost to help them reach the end. The ghost needs to use the enemies to interact with elements within the dungeon to help the human too. </p>
<p>The player however, must tactically avoid enemies and when out of sight the player can summon their ghost and posses them. If spotted by the enemy the ghost will be too afraid to appear. </p>
