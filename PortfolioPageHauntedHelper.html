<p>This game was a team of five one week long games jam. My main responsibilities were lead project, designer and developer.<br>
   Additionally I implemented my own voice, created some audio, VFX and altered the lighting for the game.<br>
   The game was heavily inspired by 'The Legend of Zelda, Link's Awakening' for the 'Nintendo Switch' and the 'Nintendo DS' game 'The Legend of Zelda Spirit Tracks'. The games Jam's theme this time was a 'helping hand'.<br>
   I wanted to create a game where the player would use their adversaries to solve puzzles and complete levels.<br>
   This project was a test for me to create a game in Unity in a short time frame.</p>
 </section>

      <h2>Problems and Solutions</h2>
        <h5>The Player Character</h5>
      <p>Mechanics</p>
      <p>The initial problem I wanted to address was to create a system where the human character would reach the goal and finish the level.<br>
         The player needed a way to get 'something' to help them through the level, this led to the creation of the ghost.<br>
         The player could swap their character to the ghost and using the same button could take over and manipulate enemies and use their ability.<br>
         However, I wanted the human character to still be vulnerable when using the ghost.<br>
         During ghost mode the human can't move at all, this means the player has to think about placing the human out of harm's way.<br>
         To add more tension to the game I needed a method to stop the player using a ghost at all times, otherwise the player could just use this whenever they are being chased.<br>
         To counter this, I added a detection system which if the player is within a range they won't be able to summon the ghost.<br>
         Using a mixture of UI, VFX and audio changes I was able to communicate this to the player. Additionally possessing enemies would also give them an aura and change the camera colours.</p>

      <h5>Enemies</h5>
      <p>Enemies needed to have a singular ability which could be used both against the player or for the player's benefit once being controlled.<br>
         Every enemy needed to be able to possess and detect the player from range.<br>
         Whilst numerous enemies were planned only two were implemented. One was a demon wall based on the Nurikabe and another a dark knight.<br>
         The wall acted as a way to teach the player safely how to use the possession mechanic, future levels, it could be used to block off enemies, open secret pathways etc.<br>
         The knight would be a mobile unit who had their own specific patrol points, additionally they would swing a sword which could defeat the player or hit switches.<br></p>

      <h5>Story and Level Structure</h5>
      <p>The story was fairly simplistic, purely escaping a dungeon with your companion, a ghost. The level structure was designed as a tutorial/opening level.<br>
         The level needed to have ways for the player to escape the knight if caught and the teleporters were a way to do this.<br>
         The overall size of the level was meant to be completed in about 2-5 minutes as it would lead on to bigger levels.</p>
      <!--
<p>The game was heavily inspired by The Legend of Zelda, Link's Awakening for the switch and the DS game legend of Zelda Spirit Tracks. The games Jam's theme this time was a "helping hand".<br>
 The main objective for the player is to navigate the dungeon and get the human to reach the goal.<br>
 Using the ability to use your ghost, the player will now take control of the ghost, the ghost has the ability to posses both the human and enemies in the scene.<br>
Each enemy has their own unique ability, that the player gets to use whilst possessed.<br>
This fits the theme perfectly, as the human needs the ghost to help them reach the end. The ghost needs to use the enemies to interact with elements within the dungeon to help the human too. <br>
The player however, must tactically avoid enemies and when out of sight the player can summon their ghost and posses them. If spotted by the enemy the ghost will be too afraid to appear. <br>

      <h2>Responsibilities</h2>
      <p>This games jam took place during the final week of my games engine bootcamp, during this time we were learning a variety of topics and skills in the Unity engine.</p> 
      <p> I wanted to showcase my understanding of the engine and a multitude of what I learned. </p>
      <p>This meant I undertook tasks which are usually out of my field. </p>
      <p>More polish and refinement was needed after the initial upload, which lead me to do additional tasks.</p>
      
      
          <p>This is my first games jam using Unity.</p>
          <p>Creating the game design (Game rules, mechanics, players, enemies, level progression). </p>
          <p>Level Blockout and design</p>
          <p>Managing the team.</p>
          <p>Asset placement.</p>
          <p>Audio Creation via cakewalk and implementation in Unity, including mixers</p>

          <p>VFX & Shaders.</p>
          <p>UI/UX.</p>
          <p>C# Programming</p>
          <p>Learned more from my coders who tweaked my code to make it more efficient.</p>
          <p>Camera Post Processing effect, tweaking.</p>
          <p>Implementing new assets, such as 3D models, animations, timelines, skyboxes</p>

      <h2>Character Mechanics</h2>

      <p>Action Ability: Player can use the left click when they have possessed certain characters to perform a task, such as the knight being able to swing it's sword. </p>

      <h2>Enemy Mechanics</h2>

      <p>All enemies have a sight radius if they see the human player, it will stop the player from summoning the ghost.</p>
      
      <h4>Demon Wall</h4>
    
      <p>Movement: this provides no challenge to the player but acts as a way to teach the player the possession mechanic. </p>
    
      
      <h4>Knight</h4>
  
      <p>Movement.</p>
      <p> Sword Swing: Can be used to open levers (when possessed), or attack and kill the human player. </p>
