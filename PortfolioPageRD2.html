<h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>This is my first professional project in the games industry. This is still a work in progress, and is currently waiting for more funding before it can be continued.</p> 
         <p>This showcases 8 months of  the teams work, with all the game design, blueprint functionality including,  the player (car), waypoints, number plate changing to correspond with the drivers action, as well as level structure.</p>
        <p> I also had  weekly meetings with another member and mentor to discuss the game design for the project as well as the projects progression.  </p>
        <p>The team would have regular playtest sessions, and the feedback on the car would be reworked and tweaked as necessary. Compared to the UE5 default Chaos vehicle, a lot of changes were implemented to get it to play as it does in this build.</p>

      <h2>Responsibilities</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>Designed the mechanics of the car and provided balancing throughout development using Unreal Engine 5’s Chaos vehicle system. </li>
          <li>UI/UX implementation including the numberplate and car’s emoji. This provided player feedback based on their actions.  </li>
          <li>Designing level flow and missions. </li>
          <li>Designed elements that would add to and make a diverse driving experience, such as ramps, and elevations. </li>
          <li>Creating and distributing builds. </li>
          <li>Transferring data using the game instance to allow level progression to work correctly. </li>
          <li>Source control. </li>
          <li> Optimising the game, draw calls, data layers, material, lighting and VFX optimisation.</li>
          <li>Provided assistance to colleagues, which includes teaching them about Unreal Engine, implementing audio and dialogue. </li>
          <li> Meetings with colleagues which included playtesting sessions, current progress, the next week’s objectives, monthly milestones and more.</li>
          <li>Monthly video recorded documentation. </li>
          <li>Research for plugins and implementation. </li>
      </ul>

<!--Story section-->
    <section>
      <h2>Synopsis/Demo</h2>
      
      <p>In this build the player has to navigate the mountain into the main city, collecting the blue beacons/waypoints as a guide. </p>
      <p>After this a set of red beacons will appear, same principle. Once the player collects the final one, they are ambushed by the police.</p>
      <p>Once they escape they are tasked with locating the green beacon within the allotted time. If the player achieves this they will get a different line of dialogue.</p> 
      <p>If not then the player will be given additional beacons to help guide them to the end of the level.</p> 
      <p>This acts as a soft win, lose condition.</p>
      <p>After this the player is then teleported to the past, here the player must complete the race doing so will cause a change in the main city of the distant future, allowing the player to proceed.</p>
