<h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>This is my first professional project in the games industry.</p> 
      <p>This showcases 8 months of my work for the project.</p>
      <p>The team would have regular playtest sessions, and the feedback on the car would be reworked and tweaked as necessary. <br>Compared to the UE5 default Chaos vehicle, a lot of changes were implemented to get it to play as it does in this build.</p>
    </section>

    <h2>Problems and Solutions</h2>
      <h5>The Car</h5>
    <ul>
    <li>The main problem was how to adapt Unreal Engine 5's Chaos vehicle system designed for realistic cars to create an arcade car.</li>
    <li>The team wanted to craft an open world driving experience similar to the games 'Need for Speed Most Wanted' and 'Burnout'.</li>
    <li>Researching and playing these games, I decided on some mechanics to utilise and tweaked the cars parameters to get it closer to the teams goal.</li>
    <li>The car needed to have abilities or functions player's of racing/driving games have come to expect such as a boost and a drift, this lead to the next issue how should the player get access to these mechanics (default or unlockable).</li>
    <li>The team wanted to include narrative that the car had an AI inside it. I decided how could I utilise this idea into being both enjoyable for the player and helpful?</li>
    <li>I created two UI elements one for the numberplate and an emoticon which appears on the back of the car, both of these will display different properties based on the player's actions.</li>
    <li>Added additional sounds and effects to help give the AI personality.</li>
    <li>The sense of speed was another issue that needed to be addressed in conjunction with the AI, I decided on having a spoiler animate when the player reaches a certain speed, this allowed the player to have a visual que on their actions.</li>
    </ul>
      <h5>Story and Level Structure.</h5>
      <ul>
    <li>The team also wanted to embed a story that when the player cleared certain missions and objectives the world would change.</li>
    <li>I had to create a scenario that would fit the intended goals of the team, but also be enjoyable for the player.</li>
    <li>I needed to create a scenario where the player would immidiately be driving and have something to accomplish and give them enough space and environmental set pieces to gaze apon as they made their way to the city.</li>
    <li>The next problem was getting something to occur in the main world by doing something in another level.</li>
    <li>This lead to new sections of the world map unlocking by completing other objectives such as races. The primary target for the demo was to have a bridge appear after winning a race in the past.</li>
    </ul>

      <p>In this build the player has to navigate the mountain into the main city, collecting the blue beacons/waypoints as a guide. </p>
      <p>After this a set of red beacons will appear, same principle. Once the player collects the final one, they are ambushed by the police.</p>
      <p>Once they escape they are tasked with locating the green beacon within the allotted time. If the player achieves this they will get a different line of dialogue.</p> 
      <p>If not then the player will be given additional beacons to help guide them to the end of the level.</p> 
      <p>This acts as a soft win, lose condition.</p>
      <p>After this the player is then teleported to the past, here the player must complete the race doing so will cause a change in the main city of the distant future, allowing the player to proceed.</p>
