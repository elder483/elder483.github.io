    <h2>Overview</h2>

      <div class = "initialImage sakuraCell">
      <img loading= "lazy" src="Images/SakuraCell/Images/SakuraCellTitle.png" width="400px" height= "300px" alt="Sakura Cell Project Title Screen">
      </div>

         <p>This was one of two solo university projects I made for my final year. My primary role and focus was design.<br>
            Additionally I created everything for this game.<br>
            This game is an endless runner in which the player uses Sakura's teleportation ability to escape the prison.<br>
            This game was developed for mobile devices and utilised touch screen controls to jump, teleport and activate power-ups.<br>
           

            <section>
      <h2>Problems and Solutions</h2>
        <h5>The Player Character</h5>
        <p>The main focus was the player's ability to teleport and how to manage it.<br>
           I wanted the teleport system to be used as a risk reward tool, allowing you to destroy enemies if you teleport on them,<br> 
           but increasing your distance means you can't anticipate what occurs ahead.<br>
           I decided to implement a magic point system, it would cost a certain amount of magic to teleport.<br>
           Inspired by 'Super Smash Bros Ultimates' iteration of the 'Hero from Dragon Quest', I adopted a similar method to managing MP.<br>
           This works that every second the player runs 1MP is generated and capped at the maximum capacity.<br>
           The next issue was how does the player gain any progression during the run?<br>
           Aside from a distance score, I decided to add crystals. By collecting these the player can increase their maximum capacity.<br>
           The teleport mechanic worked in a way that the player could backtrack as well if they missed a crystal, allowing players to collect multiple crystals.<br>
           I also decided that due to the complexity of the game and the chances of an immediate demise a health system was needed to enjoy a well paced run.<br> 
           I decided to incorporate some single use abilities to increase survivability. <br>
           These abilities consist of a magnet which will increase the range that the player can acquire crystals, healing and invincibility.</p>

          <h5>Enemies and Obstacles</h5>
            <p>My main issue for this game was providing an array of enemies and obstacles for the player to overcome.<br>
               I wanted to have some enemies provide health damage to the player and others provide damage to the magic value.<br>
               I had three enemies that dealt damage to the player red lasers and Policebots would deal a single flower of damage.<br>
               The Captain Policebot (red) would deal three points out of the player's five.<br>
               Blue lasers will negate some magic points instead.<br>
               Every adversary was designed so the player could jump over them if they timed it right or teleport past them.<br>
               If the player ran out of magic this gave them a chance to overcome the obstacle.</p>

              <h5>Story and Level Structure</h5>
              <p>The main story has Sakura being locked up in a prison for being gifted with a supernatural ability.<br>
                 The level structure has various tiles with various abilities, each platform has different coloured lights which dictates their behaviour.<br>
                 There are seven types of platforms, yellow, police, red, blue, purple and green and grey. <br> 
                 Yellow tiles also flash the word danger and then after a second they will plummet causing the player to jump or teleport to the next tile.<br>
                 Green tiles have a chance to spawn a pick-up, purples have a chance to spawn crystals.<br>
                 Police tiles have a chance to spawn police bots, red will spawn red lasers and blue, blue lasers.<br>
                 Grey platforms are neutral and provide a brief respite and a sense of safety.<br>
                 To help showcase when a player has landed on a platform the overall design will change the grey platform's colour to pink and leave the lights the same colour.<br>
                 This became more important for the yellow platforms to indicate to the player they have landed on one and it will soon fall.<br>
                 Tiles were designed in rows of three a top, middle and bottom path.<br> 
                 This allowed the user to utilise their teleporting abilities to avoid enemies, by reaching a different level.</p>
              
              
           <!--
        <p>Developed in Unreal Engine 4</p> 
      <p>A prototype and final year project, experimenting with touch controls to create various mechanics.</p>
      <p>Experimented with 2D animation, 2D VFX via flipbooks, cooldowns and powerups.</p>
      <p>Implemented UI to be operated via the users touch</p>

  <h4>Gameplay</h4>
      
      <p>The player will run automatically, the player has the ability to jump and teleport (teleport consumes MP on use) in terms of movement. Swiping up to jump, and tapping the screen will teleport the player to that location.</p>
      <p>3 Pickups in build: Invincibility, Heal and Magnet</p>
      <p>Collecting magic gems will increase the players maximum magic capacity (Every gem provides an additional 10 MP)</p>

<h4>Enemies & obstacles</h4>

  
      <p>Police bots: Will apply 1 point of health damage.</p>
      <p>Captain bots: A pallet swap of the police bot deals 3 health points of damage.</p>
      <p>Red laser: Will reduce 1 point of health.</p>
      <p>Blue laser: Will reduce 50 MP per hit (the cost of one teleport).</p>
      <p>Gravity platforms: These yellow lighted platforms will fall when the player walks on them.</p>
