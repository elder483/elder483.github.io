      <h2>Synopsis/Demo</h2>
      
    <p>REM is a platformer game set in a dream world.
       The player must travel through her dream and then escape her nightmare, they will encounter many obstacles along the way only with their trusty plush can they make it to the end. 
       REM has two main mechanics for the player to utilise both with dual functionality. Slam to break objects blocking Rem's way and also use it to navigate the level and gain extra height. 
       Throw the plush can be used similarly to break objects, hit enemies, hit buttons to trigger in game events and it can be used in conjunction with the soul shift mechanic where the player can control the plush.</p>

      <h2>Character Mechanics</h2>
      
    <ol>
      <l>Jump: Player can use this to traverse the world additionally some mechanics require the player to jump first.</l>
      <l>Slam: The player can perform a slam, when they have the plus in their hand, in doing so it can break walls and even gain some extra height acting as a double jump.</l>
      <l>Aim: The player an use the right mouse button to create a reticle, this will dictate the direction in which their plush will travel once thrown.</l>
      <l>Throw: With the plush in hand the player can throw the plush once they are aiming. This can also be used to combat enemies or hit far away switches and break objects. </l>
      <l>Recall: Once the plush is thrown, calling the plush will allow it to return to the players hand.</l>
      <l>Soul Switch: This allows the player to take control of the plush (must be thrown) or back to the player. This will allow the plush to solve puzzles which will allow the player to progress. </l>
      
    </ol>
