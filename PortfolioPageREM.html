<h2>Overview</h2>

      <p>This project was a 7 person 6 week games jam. My primary roles in this project were lead project, designer and developer.<br>
         Additionally, I learned a lot of new skills and at times some individuals didn't perform their roles due to absences, I chose to accommodate for this by filling their roles myself.<br>
         In hindsight I should have focused more on my own skills, however, this was a good learning experience.<br>
         REM is a platformer puzzle game which requires the player together with their plush solve puzzles and escape their nightmare.<br>
         As this was an employment pathway, the theme was 'Showcase your Skills'. The main takeaway from this project is my ability to adapt to other roles under pressure.<br>  
         Submitted as part of the Tranzfuser Games Jam <div loading= "lazy" data-iframe-width="150" data-iframe-height="270" data-share-badge-id="786b5654-dc29-4019-b4c4-513193cbee8c" data-share-badge-host="https://www.credly.com"></div><script type="text/javascript" async src="//cdn.credly.com/assets/utilities/embed.js"></script>
          </p>
      
      <h2>Problems and Solutions</h2>
        <h5>The Player Character</h5>
      <p>The primary problem I wanted to address was what mechanics should the player have and how can I use them for multiple actions in the world.<br>
         The first mechanic I implemented was a slam attack, this occurs when the player presses the button whilst airborne.<br>
         This mechanic could be used to attack enemies, break certain floors and it would also act as a way to gain extra height as the player would bounce after hitting the ground.<br>
         This was also my answer to a double jump.<br>
         The plush could also be thrown and recalled like a boomerang, however, this was inspired by 'Kratos's Leviathan Axe from God of War'.<br>
         This could attack enemies, break rocks, activate buttons, keeping to my personal theme of mechanics having multiple functions.<br>
         When the plush is away from Re she can't attack or perform many actions.<br>
         However, using the soul switch mechanic the player could take control of the plush (plush must be out of Rem's hand) to activate buttons that Rem herself can't reach.</p>
      
      <h5>Enemies</h5>
      <p>I decided to create enemies that had different abilities to combat Rem.<br>
         The first was a bat with a singular eye, I wanted this to shoot an orb that would draw Rem close and damage her.<br>
         The main concern was if the gravitational pull was too strong it could affect platforming if enemies were placed near ledges.<br>
         The second enemy was a spider creature that would shoot balls of web, this would create a net and slow down Rem's movement speed as well as damage her.<br>
         The snake would shoot a blob of poison that would do continuous damage for a duration.<br>
         The old lady would be more savage, she would rush at Rem and do a flurry of slashes, this encourages the player to keep their distance.<br>
         The boss of the game, the Demon's Eye, will rain meteors down on the player, additionally the eye would have a singular weak point and the player would have to throw the plush at it.<br>
         If the player hit any other part of the eye the plush would be recalled to the player.</p>

      <h5>Story and Level Structure</h5>
      <p>The first level was designed to showcase and teach the player their mechanics, as some have multiple uses it was important to show what was possible early on.<br>
         The initial section was designed as a relatively safe space with the initial bat enemy. This meant the player could work out basic fundamentals of jumping and attacking.<br>
         The player could skip the first creature entirely if they wanted to. Then the player was introduced to the slam mechanic using a graffiti style to display commands on walls.<br>
         The next step was to inform the player of the SoulShift mechanic and in a similar manner provided a segment where the player needed to utilise it to progress.<br> 
         Experimenting with sequencer allowed me to show the player the results of their actions and progression.<br>
         The second level introduced more enemies and platforming sections, alongside more puzzles.</p>

<!-- <section>
      <h2>Character Mechanics</h2>
      
      <p>Jump: Player can use this to traverse the world additionally some mechanics require the player to jump first.</p>
      <p>Slam: The player can perform a slam, when they have the plus in their hand, in doing so it can break walls and even gain some extra height acting as a double jump.</p>
      <p>Aim: The player an use the right mouse button to create a reticle, this will dictate the direction in which their plush will travel once thrown.</p>
      <p>Throw: With the plush in hand the player can throw the plush once they are aiming. This can also be used to combat enemies or hit far away switches and break objects. </p>
      <p>Recall: Once the plush is thrown, calling the plush will allow it to return to the players hand.</p>
      <p>Soul Switch: This allows the player to take control of the plush (must be thrown) or back to the player. This will allow the plush to solve puzzles which will allow the player to progress. </p>

      <h2>Synopsis/Demo</h2>
      
       <p>REM is a platformer game set in a dream world.<br>
          The player must travel through her dream and then escape her nightmare, they will encounter many obstacles along the way only with their trusty plush can they make it to the end. <br>
          REM has two main mechanics for the player to utilise both with dual functionality. Slam to break objects blocking Rem's way and also use it to navigate the level and gain extra height. <br>
          Throw the plush can be used similarly to break objects, hit enemies, hit buttons to trigger in game events and it can be used in conjunction with the soul shift mechanic where the player can control the plush.</p>
