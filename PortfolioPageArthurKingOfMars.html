<p>This was an 11 person weekend long gamesjam. My primary roles was lead boss designer for The Lady of the Lake and developer of her boss battle.<br>
   Additionally I designed mechanics for the remaining bosses.<br>
   Created for the global Games Jam 2021<a href= "https://globalgamejam.org/2021/games/arthur-flashdragon-8">Global games Jam Submission</a><br>
   The game is a first person action game focusing on melee combat, designed to be a boss rush experience.<br>
   The theme for the project was lost and found, our concept was King Arthur lost his sword, crown and companions and had to retrieve them.</p>
        
    </section>
<section>
<h2>Problems and Solutions</h2>
  <h5>Lady of the Lake</h5>
  <p>Mechanics</p>
  <p>The intial problem I needed to address is in this stage of the game the lady of the lake would be the first boss and Arthur would be at his weakest state.<br>
     This meant Lady of the Lake needed to have less health than the other bosses to compensate for Arthur's damage output.<br>
     I knew early on I wanted to make water based attacks that would keep the player moving. Geysers of water that home in on the player and single shot projectiles provided this challenge.<br> 
     The next mechanic I chose to incorporate was a dash/teleport move which would give the Lady of the Lake a quick way to evade Arthur.<br>
     If I chose not to implement this feature the boss would remain stationary, making the fight not only effortless but not engaging.<br>
     With Excalibur providing an ability to air dash, I needed to find a way to teach the player how to jump prior to the next boss.<br>
     I decided to incorporate a phase 2 to the boss fight. During this phase the Lady of the lake would hover at the center of the arena and create geysers again.<br>
     This time however the geysers would also have a rock on top. This required the player to jump on these rocks and whilst being lifted jump and then strike the Lady of the Lake.<br>
     The rocks themselves would apply no damage but if the player walked under these and into the geysers they would take damage.<br>
     Whilst suspended in the air, I needed a way for the lady of the lake to do damage to the player as a reaction to proximity, a spin attack where geysers would appear from her hands would repel the player.</p>

   <h5>Morgana</h5>
  <p>Mechanics</p>
  <p>With Exaclibur in hand Arthur's damage output increased and could now air dash, to compensate for this the new boss needed to encourage the player to air-dash.<br>
     Originally Morgana's only attack was going to be a slam of tentacles, however I suggested to implement leeches that would follow the player hit the player and defeat them on impact.<br>
     I concepted two types of leeches, smaller leeches move quicker and deal smaller amounts of damage, this meant that using the air dash to dodge them was useful.
     The second which would appear in phase 2 were larger in scale, slower but dealt larger damage were also introduced.<br>
     The combonation of the two leeches and the tentacle slams provided an interesting experience for a stationary boss.</p>

   <h5>Merlin</h5>
  <p>Mechanics</p>
  <p>I designed the central mechanic to Merlin, I was inspired by 'The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time's Ganondorf' boss battle.<br>
     Merlin would fire a magic orb which the player would have to time their attacks to launch the orb back at Merlin.<br>
     This method was used as a way for the player to master their timing of attacks where as bosses prior didn't have this requirement.<br>  
     Merlin would also remain airborn for a large majority of the time meaning the player would have to pick their moments to approach him when grounded.<br>
     Merlin would become Ascended rather than having a second phase, this was intended to be the ultimate challenge.<br>
     In this segment, Merlin would use Morgana's tentacles a powered-up version of his orb and was intended to use some mechanics from the lady of the lake.<br>
     However, due to time constraints only Morgana's moves were incorporated.</p>

      <h2>Level Mechanics</h2>
      
    
      <p>Each environment is constructed to support the boss and player's mechanics. This includes rocks to jump on or hit closer to a boss.</p>
 
      
    
      
    </section>

    <section class = "mechanics">
      <h2>Boss Mechanics</h2>
      
      <h4>Lady of the Lake</h4>
   <h5>Phase 1</h5>
   <p>The Lady of the Lake in this phase is swift and enjoys keeping the player on their feet, with a few projectiles and a dash.</p>


      <p>Aqua Shot: Fires a fast orb of water that homes towards the player.</p>
      <p>Water Geyser: A slow moving projectile that will home towards the player, with the aim to keep the player moving around.</p>
      <p>Teleport Dash: The Lady of the Lake doesn't enjoy sitting still for too long, and will dash to another location, this keeps the player moving frequently.</p>

      
      <h5>Phase 2</h5>
      <p> During this phase the Lady of the Lake, enjoys staying airborn, utilising her rising rocks mechanic the player can jump and strike her.</p>
      
       <p>Rising Rocks: Creates rocks being risen by geysers, the geysers will hurt the player so staying above them is key. Utilise these rocks as platforms to hurt the boss.</p>
       <p>Spinning Geyser: The Lady of the Lake will create twin geysers from her palms, and spin causing damage to the player, this is a deterent causing the player to time their strikes. </p>
      

        <h4>Morgana</h4>
   <h5>Phase 1</h5>
   <p>Morgana utilises her tentacles to strike the player, additionally her barage of leeches will keep the player running.</p>
      

      <p>Leeches: Spawns sentient leeches that will chase the player, dealing damage when they hit the player.</p>
      <p>Tentacles: Slams the ground and the player if they remain close to Morgana.</p>
      
      
      <h5>Phase 2</h5>
      <p> During this phase Morgana's tentacle slams are more frequent and she unleashes larger leeches as well, causing higher damage.</p>
      
       <p>Giant Leeches: Slower than normal leeches but provide more damage, in combination with the smaller leeches the player should avoid these.</p>
      

         <h4>Merlin</h4>
   <h5>Phase 1</h5>
   <p>Merlin utilises magic orbs and requires the player to strike back the orbs focuses in timing.</p>
      

      <p>Magic orbs: Spawns magic orbs that home towards the player, striking them will send them back towards Merlin.</p>
      
    
      
      <h5>Phase 2</h5>
      <p> Merlin has Acsended, Merlin ascended now fires stronger projectiles but also summons tentacles and leeches from Morgana.</p>
      
       <p>Tentacles: These flail and try to strike the player.</p>

      <h2>Synopsis</h2>
      
    <p>Hundreds of years ago King Arthur sealed himself away under Britain, waiting to spring forth at its moment of most dire need.... well, that came and went.<br>
       Britain has moved to Mars and you wake up a few hundred years too late, your former friends rather disgruntled at this, need you to prove yourself worthy of calling yourself King Arthur.<br>  
       Battle through 3 boss fights to reclaim what you have lost; Excalibur, your Crown and the respect of your closest friend.</p>
