<h2>Overview</h2>

      <p>This was one of two solo university project I made for my final year. My primary role and focus was level design.<br>
         Additionally I created everything for this game.<br>
         This game is a puzzle adventure game inspired by 'The Legend of Zelda' the 'strength' mechanic in 'Pokemon'.</p>
    </section>

       <h2>Problems and Solutions</h2>
      <h5>The Player Character</h5>
      <p>The main issue was to try and replicate the strength mechanic, but I wanted it to provide more purpose than shifting an obstacle.<br>
         I decided to create a system were blocks of ice are pushed into gaps to create pathways.<br>
         I made the level dark and provided a Japanese style lantern to be lit near the begining to signifiy to the player this is what they needed to accomplish.<br>
         This also provided light to make it easier for the player to see where they were going.<br>
         I wanted some form of combat even if it was basic, the player could throw their sword and it would return to them, this could also be used to hit the ice blocks.</p>

      <h5>Enemy</h5>
      <p>This game only had 1 enemy, however, I needed it to feel both like a boss but easy enough for the player to defeat it as this is their only opportunity for combat.<br>
         I decided to make it shoot icicles from the sky, this would spawn above the player's head meaning they would have to quickly move out of the way.<br>
         Once the boss was defeated the path would open allowing the player to finish the level.</p>

    <h5>Story and level design.</h5>
      <p>The story for this game is the protagonist has discovered a cave they must fight the ice demon that dwells there and escape.<br>
        As the main focus was on level design, I spent some time drawing up concepts of the level flow and the route that the player would have to take.<br>
        I wanted the lanterns to be lit to unlock the next step of the level. This meant I had to place one early on for the player to know of it's purpose.<br>
        The ice blocks forming new paths needed to be obvious for the player to progress.<br>
        The most difficult part of this challenge was to make sure the solution was both easy to work out but also not obvious.<br>
        Due to the nature of the order in which you can create paths there needed to be enough ice blocks to form every path.</p>
